## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

### First Tool - PROVEAN

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 
This tool is used for studies involving amino acids. It can predict if a substitution or indel will change the function of a protein made from it.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

This tool works by inputting amino acid data, where then the tool clusters the information and calculates a score, which tells the user if the mutation on the amino acid causes a change (Deleterious) or if the change was benign (Neutral).

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

I think this tool was made to help researchers quickly find out if an amino acid mutation is relevant to their research- if it will change the function of a protein they may be studying.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

If the chance that an amino acid mutates is inheritable, and that mutation causes a protein to not work which in turn causes some kind of disease or problem, people could decide that the best way to prevent that disease would be to do something like eugenics, which would be morally reprehensible.


### Second Tool - Genome-wide association study (GWAS)

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

This method is used to try and identify genes that may cause a disease.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

This method works by looking through the genome of people with the disease for variations that are not as common/not found at all in people without the disease.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

I think this method was necessary to develop, as it creates an easy first step when trying to see what causes a disease. By comparing the DNA of those with the disease with those without, you can quickly cross off or confirm whether someone's DNA causes their condition.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

If this method causes scientists to confirm that DNA is the cause of the disease and that it is hereditary, people may choose to abort their future kids just because they are disabled, something many people may see as wrong. Another example could be that a researcher left on the people's name with their data, leaking who had the disease, which is a big breach of privacy.
